Since we're having trouble converting the custom model, we can use a pre-trained DenseNet169 
model from TensorFlow Hub as a temporary solution.

## Update the Model Loading Code

In your `src/app/xray-tool/page.tsx` file, find the model loading code:

```typescript
const loadedModel = await tf.loadLayersModel('/model/densenet169/model.json');
```

And replace it with:

```typescript
// Use a pre-trained DenseNet169 model from TensorFlow Hub
const loadedModel = await tf.loadLayersModel(
  'https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/tfjs-model/densenet169/classification/1/default/1'
);
```

This will use a pre-trained ImageNet model as a fallback.

## Modify the Prediction Format

You'll also need to adjust how predictions are processed since the pre-trained model 
has a different output format (1000 ImageNet classes instead of fracture detection).

The fallback will only demonstrate the model loading and UI functionality, not actual 
fracture detection.
